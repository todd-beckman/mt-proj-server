# MT-Proj

A personal project. More to come later.

## Setting Up


- [Get Go](https://golang.org/dl/). This project currently uses version 1.8.3.
- [Get Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/install). This project currently uses version 1.22.1
- Run `make`

## Development

### Front-end

`pub run dart_dev examples` and then use http://localhost:8080 to view individual assets.

#### Build Sass

Use `make sass` to compile sass. The compiled css is committed to the repository
so sass does not become an overall dev dependency.

### Back-end 

The full stack is currently under unstable development and is subject to change.
