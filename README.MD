# MT-Proj

This might not go anywhere

### Setting Up

- [Get Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/install). This project currently uses version 1.22.1

- `pub get` to install dependencies

### Local

- Set up the rest of the stack via [mt-proj-server](https://github.com/todd-beckman/mt-proj-server)
- `pub serve`

### Development

#### Build Sass

Use `make sass` to compile sass. The compiled css is committed to the repository
so sass does not become an overall dev dependency.
